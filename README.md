# corr-spec

I simulate 2D diffusion of N particles on a grid to understand Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS).

[**Check it out here!**](https://shivchitinous.github.io/corr-spec/fcs)

Parameters that can be played around with:

1. N (Number of particles)
2. D (Diffusion coefficient of the particles)
