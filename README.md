# corr-spec
I simulate 2D diffusion of N particles on a grid and generate videos of a small field of view (FOV) on the grid. 
Using this, I calculate autocorrelation functions of pixels in this FOV to understand the basics of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.

Parameters that can be played around with:

N (Number of particles)
Df (Diffusion coefficient of the particles)
T (Time for which the video is recorded)
