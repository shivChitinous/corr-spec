# corr-spec
I simulate 2D diffusion of N particles on a grid and generate videos of the diffusing particles to understand the basics of Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS).

[Check it out here!](https://shivchitinous.github.io/corr-spec/fcs)

Parameters that can be played around with:

1. N (Number of particles)
2. Df (Diffusion coefficient of the particles)
3. T (Time for which the video is recorded)
